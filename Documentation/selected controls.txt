1. Device-Specific Configuration
These security controls are categorized based on the device types they are typically applied to.




Routers

disable telnet
enable sshv2
password encryption
password hashing (secret)
Message Of the day (banner motd)
syslog (check logging is enabled or not)
exectimeout (check if exectimeout is enabled in line vty)




Switches

port security
bpdu guard
root guard
shutdown unused ports
disable DTP on unncessary ports (non negotiate and make configure them manually)
disable cdp neighborship
dhcp snooping
Dynamic ARP Inspection
Message Of the day
syslog - check if logging is enabled | enabling
check & enabling exectimeout


Servers
syslog
automated backups

Firewall
custom rules
Disabling Telnet protocol on all interfaces




syslog
2. Attack-Specific Mitigation
These controls are specifically used to mitigate certain types of attacks.

dhcp snooping — Mitigates DHCP Snooping Attacks
dhcp starvation — Mitigates DHCP Starvation Attacks
mac address overflow — Mitigates MAC Address Table Overflow Attacks
disable cdp neighborship — Mitigates CDP-based Information Disclosure Attacks
3. Framework-Based Controls
These controls align with general security frameworks like CIS or NIST.

root guard
password encryption
Dynamic ARP Inspection
password hashing (secret)


4. Custom Controls Management
These controls provide flexibility for customization based on specific policies or environments.

Note:

Some controls (e.g., syslog, password encryption) may apply to multiple categories depending on context.
This breakdown focuses on security control functionality and how they fit into the described menus, avoiding device management beyond direct security settings.

Then propose a good way to do network benchmark like a method of scoring system and produce result based on security controls selected by user and also generate report in format of pdf which shows result summary. Give example output as well

Proposed Network Security Benchmarking and Scoring Methodology
This method allows a user to evaluate the security posture of a network by selecting security controls. A scoring system will assess the configuration's effectiveness, and a detailed report will be generated in PDF format summarizing the results.

Scoring System
Categories: The score is divided into categories reflecting the core security areas:

Device Configuration Security (30 points) — Ensures best practices for device-specific configurations.
Attack Mitigation (40 points) — Measures defenses against common attack vectors.
Framework Compliance (20 points) — Aligns with security guidelines like CIS or NIST.
Custom Controls (10 points) — Assesses additional or unique configurations.
Scoring:

Each control has a weight depending on its criticality.
A point-based system assigns scores based on control implementation:
Fully Configured: Full points.
Partially Configured: Half points.
Not Configured: Zero points.
Calculation Formula:
